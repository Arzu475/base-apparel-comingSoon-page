## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript


### What I learned
I learned new things doing this challenge, especially in terms of validating a form in javascript.


```js
var mailRegex = /^([A-Za-z0-9_\-\.])+\@([A-Za-z0-9_\-\.])+\.([A-Za-z]{2,4})$/;
```

### Continued development

In the future, maybe I will focus on learning again about JavaScript, especially in terms of validating a form.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.w3schools.blog/email-validation-javascript-js) - This really helped me in making an email validation. In the future if there are projects like this again, I will use this resource again as email validation.
